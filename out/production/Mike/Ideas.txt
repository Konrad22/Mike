Both players have 9 starting pieces, put them in a row at the left and the right of the screen. Taken pieces are placed there as well.

Stage 1: everything not occupied is a viable turn.
after setting down a stone, check if 3 stones of one color are aligned (query the stones in the row and line what color they have), if else, because even if two 3 stones are
aligned, only one piece can be removed
if 3, select any stone on the board of the opposite color to remove (3 pieces aligned in a row or line are safe, query each stone and make a set of viable stones?)
if, and only if all enemy pieces are 'safe', you can also take safe pieces (basically, if first query yields an empty set, add all enemy stones in the game to the list and choose
from those)

whenever a stone is taken, query if the other player has 3 or fewer pieces left, including those not yet set on the board
counter for how many are left outside the board, always added to the number? start query only from phase 2 onwards, if answer is yes twice for one side, game over for that side

stage 1 and stage 3 only need one entry (a set) each -> list of unoccupied board markers?
keep that set around and update it? viable move for phase 2 = intersection between list of unoccupied places and reachable places for the
specific spot <- board markers needs to be merged into game pieces for this to be viable, or list of reachable
List<GamePiece> viableMove =

in that case, no need for attribute 'occupied' in the intersection of lines?

phase 3 is special as in not both players have to be in phase 3, one is likely still in phase 2 at the time -> stages are kept separate between players, no problem for them to be
in a different stage

does that even work in java? how? I'm too stuck in python with my thinking
		//has to run until game is over
		//while true? maybe?
		//do I have to end it, or can I just make a pop up that says 'side x lost' and make any moves on the board unviable by
		//emptying the list that contains the unoccupied places?
		set free = empty list

		if color != player.color() or stone.set interesected with free == empty set
			//stone not viable to move -> if click interceptor is triggered, check the color of stone, compare if with color of player, only do something if color matches

		if clickInterceptor is triggered
		    if gamePiece.color == player.color
phases: use switch
